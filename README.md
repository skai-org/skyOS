# SkyOS - React and Rust Based Desktop Environment Simulator

SkyOS is an ongoing project that aims to simulate a desktop environment inspired by macOS. It is built using React and Rust technologies. This desktop environment simulator is currently in development and is expected to offer a range of features to enhance user experience.

## Features

### 1. Functional Store
SkyOS will include a fully functional store where developers can publish Sky Apps, and users can seamlessly discover, download, and install them. This feature encourages a thriving ecosystem of applications that contribute to the versatility of the desktop environment.

### 2. Terminal Emulator
For users familiar with command-line interfaces, SkyOS provides a terminal emulator to execute basic terminal commands. This functionality is designed to cater to both developers and power users who prefer a text-based interface for certain tasks.

SkyOS prioritizes productivity by integrating a suite of tools, including but not limited to:
- **Todo List:** Organize your tasks efficiently.
- **Tasks Manager:** Keep track of ongoing projects and their progress.
